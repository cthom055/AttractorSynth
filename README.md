# AttractorSynth
Sonification of a Chaotic attractor 

## Description:
Utilises Transform Feedback

## Install:
-Built with openframeworks of_v20161230_vs_nightly build **important** only the nightly build seems to support transform feedback, use this instead of the main branch.
-Requires [ofxMaxim]( https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian ) and [ofxImGui]( https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui )  
-All other libraries are header only and are included.
-tested on Windows VS 2015 only, this should work on OSX but only if the openframeworks transform feedback example in 'examples/gl' also works for your computer.
